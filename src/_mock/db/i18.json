      "WhatProblemDesc": "Sweet water is a limited resource, because of that calculate Water footprint in agriculture from evapotranspiration from crops is esential.",
      "TheIdeaDesc": "Project YvY is a web application that allows to measure the evapotranspiration using updated databases on cultivation and climate, interacting with weather services and the FAO56 dataset so that the producer can upload the necessary data in a simple way and obtain the evapotranspiraton. The application will also measure the carbon footprint of agriculture and can be integrated into blockchain of the food sector. This will give better visibility and traceability of the product, encouraging the incorporation of good practices. The web application and cloud information will enable data analytics on carbon and water in agriculture, integrating with sustainable and / or regenerative agriculture certification systems. The farmer will get a QR code to show the carbon and evapotranspiration, information about the farm and the crop and eventually, the information about sustainable agriculture certifications.",
      "PotentialImpactDesc": "Project YvY hopes to reach farmers in LA and the Caribbean who do not have the possibility of measuring these footprints and also large agricultural companies that are transforming their production models to improve the management of footprints in order to have the possibility of joining value chains in the food sector, serving the growing demand of conscious consumers who are also beneficiaries of this application since they will have the footprint information of the products they consume through the QR Codes.",
      "ProfileDesc": "This is your profile page. You can see the progress you've made with your work and manage your projects or assigned tasks",
      "ClimateDesc": "Thanks to the support of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator the producers have access to an extense variety of information provided by TWC, such as weather forecasts and irrigation needs, among others",
